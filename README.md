How to use applicaton:

On the screens which have textboxes (login, create account and grid options screens), you can either navigate around the application with mouse input or with keyboard input.

These are the keyboard inputs you can use:
ENTER: Confirms the input.
TAB: Switches between textboxes when one is active.
ESC: Deselects a textbox when one is active.

All other parts of the application only take mouse input.

On the select game mode screen, to see the game instructions you need to hover your mouse over the help icon the top-right corner of the screen. No clicking is needed.

For the other parts of the application, navigating around is self explanatory.
